# Fuzzy Logic Systems(3rd Assignment)

Two different applications of fuzzy systems

/--------------------------------------------------------/

<strong>1st Application</strong> -> A fuzzy system that takes as input the percentage of healthy people (x2) and the cases (x1) of a disease that follows the following Volterra functions:

<br>
The output is the danger of that disease through time.
<br>
There are four outputs for the fuzzy system:
<br>
1)--->NONE
<br>
2)--->LOW
<br>
3)--->MEDIUM
<br>
4)--->HIGH

/--------------------------------------------------------/

<strong>2nd Application</strong> -> A fuzzy control system that controls the autonomous parking of a car that follows the following equations:

<br>
where theta is the angle of the car, u is the angle of the wheels and (x,y) are the coordinates of the car.
<br>
The goal is to get the car to y = 0 and theta = 0.
